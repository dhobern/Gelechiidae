title: Catalogue of World Gelechiidae
alias: Gelechiidae
description: "The Catalogue of World Gelechiidae derives from a summary of the Gelechiidae\
  \ list developed and maintained as a Word document by Klaus Sattler at the Natural\
  \ History Museum, London. This list was converted in 2021 by Donald Hobern to form\
  \ this Catalogue of Life Data Package dataset. Many species previously included\
  \ as Gelechiidae within the COL Checklist from the NHM Global Lepidoptera Names\
  \ Index (LepIndex) are not recognised within the family by Klaus Sattler. Most of\
  \ these are now considered to belong to other families within the Gelechioidea,\
  \ but 40 genera and 62 species cannot yet be assigned to any other family. These\
  \ have been included as \"provisionally accepted\" taxa within this dataset but\
  \ are likely to be moved elsewhere in the COL Checklist in future."
