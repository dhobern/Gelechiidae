# Data files for Catalogue of World Gelechiidae

The CSV files in this repository together form the contents of a [Catalogue of Life Data Package](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/coldp) (CoLDP file).

This CoLDP dataset is for the [Catalogue of World Gelechiidae](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset/2362/about), a continuously maintained checklist of the Gelechiidae, the twirler moths. The dataset derives from the work of Klaus Sattler at the Natural History Museum, London. This was restructured in 2022 as v1.0 of this dataset and added to the [Catalogue of Life](http://www.catalogueoflife.org/) as a component for this group of moths.

These files are added here to enable versioning and tracking.
